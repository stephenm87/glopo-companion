# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers of this Global Politics educational tool, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Academic Integrity

As an educational tool designed for scholars, academic integrity is paramount. Users are expected to:

- Use the insights and analyses generated by this tool as a supplement to, not a replacement for, their own critical thinking and research.
- Properly cite and attribute any use of this tool in their academic work.
- Avoid using the tool to gain an unfair advantage in assessments.

## Respectful Political Discourse

Global Politics involves discussing complex, sensitive, and often controversial topics. To ensure a productive learning environment:

- **Objectivity**: Users should strive for objectivity and look for multi-perspective evidence-based analysis.
- **Inflammatory Language**: Avoid using inflammatory, derogatory, or dehumanizing language when discussing political case studies, actors, or ideologies.
- **Respect**: Treat all perspectives with intellectual respect, focusing on deconstructing arguments rather than attacking individuals or groups.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The Project Lead is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

The Project Lead has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Project Lead responsible for enforcement at the contact information below. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
